			<h1>NitroType Cheat - Usage</h1>
			<h3>In this guide you will learn how to use the NitroType Cheat</h3>
			<a href="/">[Return To Home]</a>
			<i>Cheat is only Available on Windows Devices</i>
			<hr>
			<h2>Step 1</h2>
			<p>
				If you have the cheat installed the usage is fairly straightforward.<br>
				<br>
				You can change the cheats speed with the speed slider and accuracy with the accuracy slider.<br>
				<br>
				If you check the auto start cheat feature then you will need to enter a new race before it works.<br>
				<br>
				God mode will remove the speed slider option entirely and go as fast as possible. It will also
				run at the max accuracy.
